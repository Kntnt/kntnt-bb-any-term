# Kntnt's Any Term for Beaver Builder Page Builder

It can for instance be used to create reading recommendations at the end of a blog post.

## Description

This WordPress plugin extends the functionality of both the [free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) and the [paid](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) versions of the *Beaver Builder Page Builder*.

### How to use the plugin

When you configure a Page Builder module that allows you to filter posts based on category, tag or any other [taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies), you will also find a special purpose term called `Any term of the post`. If you select it for a taxonomy, it will match posts that has at least on term in that taxonomy in common with the post that the module appears on. This is also true for pages and other [built in or custom post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types).

This can be used for instead to create reading recommendations at the end of a blog post. For an example, scroll down to the bottom of any article in [the online magazine of Word Trade Center in Malm√∂](https://www.wtcmalmo.se/magasinet/sex-tips-att-lyckas-internationellt/2599) (in Swedish).

### Detailed description

For each existing or in the future added taxonomy, including *category* and *tags*, this plugin adds a term with the human readable name `Any term of the post` and the machine readable name (a.k.a. slug) `kntnt-bb-any-term`.

The human readable name can be translated (or altered) through [localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/). The easiest way might be [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).

The special terms are hidden in the user interface, except for Beaver Builder Page Builder plugin, as long as the plugin is active.

If you deactivate the plugin (but not uninstall it), the special terms will be visible in the user interface as regular terms. They will be hidden again if you re-actiavate the plugin.

The special terms are completely removed when the plugin is [properly uninstalled](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Uninstalling_Plugins).
